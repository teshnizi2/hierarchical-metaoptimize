# Corrections — what actually holds

Written after an adversarial review (`REVIEW-hmkhd2.md`) checked the draft against
`results/all_runs.csv` and found several headline claims refuted by controls **in this repo**.
Each item below was re-verified against raw run outputs before being written here.

## 1. The pooling gain is budget-dependent, and the ordering INVERTS

Corrected (meta-gradient-space) pooling, `z'_b = (1-r) sum_j z_j + r z_b`, layerwise m=62:

| arm | 100 epochs (n=3) | 300 epochs (n=2) |
|---|---|---|
| scalar (r=0) | 88.14 | **92.68** |
| plain layerwise (r=1) | **91.35** | 92.01 |
| z-pool r=0.1 | 90.01 (−1.34) | **93.47 (+1.46)** |
| z-pool r=0.05 | — | **93.47 (+1.46)** |
| beta-shrink lam=0.1 | 92.79 (+1.46) | 92.61 (+0.59 best / +0.25 final) |

**At 100 epochs pooling hurts. At 300 epochs pooling wins, and scalar overtakes plain
layerwise.** The optimum in the pooling parameter moves with budget. This is the
bias–variance optimum the literature says is the defensible form of the claim — but it is
*not* the claim the draft made.

Note also that **scalar > plain layerwise at 300 epochs** reproduces the parent paper's
ImageNet observation on CIFAR-10 by lengthening the budget alone. That is a stronger version
of our budget argument than the draft's, and it is free.

## 2. The two "hierarchical" operators are NOT the same method

The draft conflated them. They are different interventions with different effects:

* **beta-shrink** (`HIER=shrink`): contract beta toward the group mean *after* the meta update.
  Helps at 100 ep (+1.46pp), fades by 300 ep (+0.25pp on plateau).
* **z-pool** (`HIER=zpool`): mix the *meta-gradient* before the update. Has exact endpoints
  (verified: sd(beta)=0.000e+00 at r=0). Hurts at 100 ep, wins at 300 ep.

They must be reported separately. Only z-pool has validated endpoints.

## 3. The +1.46pp best-lambda WAS cherry-picked
Max of 7 cells at n=3, spread 0.29pp against per-cell sd 0.08–0.23. Reporting the max of a
sweep as "the" effect is selection bias. The honest statement is the *range* across lambda
(+1.17 to +1.46), and even that is 100-epoch-specific.

Related: "flat over three orders of magnitude" is **operator saturation**, not robustness — a
per-step lambda has half-life <= 693 steps against a 50,000-step run, so every lambda >= 0.001
is fully saturated by the end. The draft presented an artefact as the method's best property.

## 4. Metric hygiene
`best-of-100-epochs` inflates over plateau accuracy by ~0.36pp median — the same order as the
effects being claimed. **Primary metric must be plateau (mean of last 5 epochs) or
epochs-to-target; best-of-run is reportable only alongside, never alone.**

## 5. Claims withdrawn
* The §3 speed table came from **unguarded** runs; with the guard the gain is ~16%, not 19%,
  and ep→85% (10.7 ± 1.2 vs 10.0 ± 0.0) is not resolvable at the ±0.02pp floor.
* §3.1's "scalar fails on 2 of 3 seeds" was already corrected to 1/3 in FINDINGS (0/3 under
  Lion). The draft quoted the superseded number.
* §5's gamma=1 trace-overflow mechanism was **refuted by our own gamma=0.999 control**, which
  failed identically. The overflow is real; the stated cause is not established.

## 6. What survives, and is missing from the draft
* **H4 base-optimizer interaction** — granularity helps under SGDm, null under AdamW. Large,
  multi-seed, unaffected by any of the above.
* **The budget inversion** (§1 here) — now the strongest result in the project.
* Results the routine produced that the draft never mentioned: a 53.1% sign-agreement
  measurement, a 4.4pp aggregation-order effect, and M1 additive reaching 93.46 at n=5.
  These need checking and, if they hold, they belong in the paper.

## 7. Process failure to avoid repeating
The refuting controls **had already completed** when the draft was written; they were produced
by the hourly routine and never reviewed. Writing prose from remembered results instead of from
`results/all_runs.csv` is what caused this. **Re-derive every table from the CSV at write time.**

## 8. The three "unreviewed" results, now verified — two are major

### 8a. M1 additive has a genuine interior optimum (plateau metric, n=5–10)

| r | plateau | n |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (= scalar) | 92.15 | 5 |
| 0.03 | 92.14 | 8 |
| **0.05** | **93.06** | 7 |
| **0.07** | **93.22** | 5 |
| 0.1 | 92.28 | 10 |
| 0.2 | 91.39 | 3 |
| 0.3 | 90.96 | 3 |

A clean inverted-U peaking at r ≈ 0.05–0.07, **+1.07pp over r=0**, measured on plateau rather
than best-of-run, at n=5–7. This is the bias–variance optimum in partial pooling that the
project set out to find, and it is the best-supported positive result we have.

### 8b. The i.i.d. / sqrt(N) noise model is REFUTED by direct measurement

The premise behind "finer granularity is noisier" is that per-coordinate meta-gradients are
near-independent, so pooling N of them shrinks drift as 1/sqrt(N). The probe measures the
premise directly:

> **53.1% of all 11,173,962 per-weight meta-gradients agree on sign.**
> Independence would give 50.0000 ± 0.0015%.

Predicted log-log slope of drift vs N: **−0.500**. Measured: **−0.113**.

The signs are strongly positively correlated, so a pooled estimate does not average toward zero —
it converges to a population bias. **Drift is governed by how much the coordinates agree, which
is a property of the partition, not by N through a sampling-noise channel.** This is the
within-block correlation the prior-art sweep identified as the one unclaimed empirical
contribution available here, and it is now measured rather than assumed.

### 8c. The alpha0 confound is quantified, and it accounts for the short-budget orderings

Pooled layerwise is 17.6pp *behind* scalar at 20 epochs and 4.5pp *ahead* at 100. The 20-epoch
ordering is fully explained by startup cost: beta must climb 6.9 log units from ln(1e-6) before
alpha is useful, and the arms escape at different rates —

| arm | epochs merely to reach a useful alpha |
|---|---|
| scalar | 13.8 |
| 6-block | 14.0 |
| layerwise | 17.3 |
| nodewise | 25.1 |

**A substantial part of what earlier tables called "the granularity effect" at short budgets is
the arms escaping a deliberately crippled initialisation at different rates.** Every
short-budget comparison at alpha0 = 1e-6 must be read with this in mind, and the alpha0 control
runs are the correct basis for any steady-state claim.

## 9. Fixes applied this round
* `analysis/aggregate.py` now emits **plateau** (mean of last 5 epochs) as primary, plus
  `ep_to_85/88/90` and guard/hier/lambda/eta_ratio provenance. Measured: best-of-run inflates
  over plateau by **0.37pp median** across 356 runs — the same order as the effects claimed.
* **Non-meta baseline launched** — plain AdamW at 4 fixed learning rates x 2 seeds. Across the
  first 275 runs there was *not one* non-meta-learned optimiser to compare against; a reviewer
  would have asked immediately.
* **Seeds raised to 5** on the 300-epoch headline cells (plain / zpool r=0.1 / scalar).
